\title{Calculate signed area of a cycle}
\usage{
cycle_signed_area(cycle, pool)
}
\arguments{
\item{cycle}{Integer vector of .vx IDs forming a closed cycle}

\item{pool}{Vertex pool data frame (from pool_vertices)}
}
\value{
Numeric signed area.
}
\description{
Calculate signed area of a cycle
}
\details{
Uses the shoelace formula to compute signed area. The sign indicates
winding direction. For typical geographic data (Simple Features convention):
\itemize{
\item Negative area = outer ring
\item Positive area = hole
}

This is intrinsic to the geometry — we observe winding, not declare it.

x <- wk::as_wkb("POLYGON ((0 0, 1 0, 1 1, 0 1, 0 0))")
pool <- establish_topology(x)
merged <- merge_coincident(pool)
cycles <- find_cycles(merged)
cycle_signed_area(cycles[[1]], pool_vertices(merged))
