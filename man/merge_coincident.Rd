\title{Merge coincident vertices in a pool}
\usage{
merge_coincident(x, tolerance = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A wkpool}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric tolerance for coordinate matching.
Default 0 means exact match only.}
}
\value{
A wkpool with shared vertices merged (fewer unique vertices)
}
\description{
Merge coincident vertices in a pool
}
\details{
With tolerance = 0, only exactly identical coordinates are merged.
The first occurrence becomes the canonical vertex.

This is where you discover shared boundaries between polygons,
network connectivity, mesh topology, etc.

Feature provenance (.feature) is preserved - segments keep their
original feature assignment even after vertex merging.

x <- wk::as_wkb(c(
  "POLYGON ((0 0, 1 0, 1 1, 0 1, 0 0))",
  "POLYGON ((1 0, 2 0, 2 1, 1 1, 1 0))"
))
pool <- establish_topology(x)
topology_report(pool)
merged <- merge_coincident(pool)
