\title{Establish topology from any wk-handleable geometry}
\usage{
establish_topology(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Any geometry wk can handle (sf, sfc, wkb, wkt, geos, s2, xy, ...)}

\item{...}{reserved for future use}
}
\value{
A wkpool object (segments with vertex pool)
}
\description{
Establish topology from any wk-handleable geometry
}
\details{
Vertices are minted as-is from the input coordinates.
No snapping or deduplication is performed - the pool represents
the exact truth of the input geometry. Use merge_coincident()
afterward to discover/establish shared topology.

Segments track their feature origin via \code{.feature} attribute,
enabling discovery of shared boundaries and neighbour relations.

x <- wk::as_wkb(c(
  "MULTIPOLYGON (((0 0, 0 1, 0.75 1, 1 0.8, 0.5 0.7, 0.8 0.6, 0.69 0, 0 0), (0.2 0.2, 0.5 0.2, 0.5 0.4, 0.3 0.6, 0.2 0.4, 0.2 0.2)))",
