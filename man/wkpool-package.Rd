\title{wkpool: Vertex Pool Topology for Well-Known Geometry}
\description{
Establishes and maintains vertex pool topology for geometry handled by 'wk'. Segments are the atomic unit, vertices are shared via integer references into a pool. Topology is discoverable (via coincident vertex detection) not imposed - representing the truth of the input.
