\title{Find closed cycles (rings) in segment graph}
\usage{
find_cycles(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A wkpool (ideally after merge_coincident)}
}
\value{
A list of integer vectors, each containing .vx IDs forming a closed cycle
}
\description{
Find closed cycles (rings) in segment graph
}
\details{
Walks the segment graph to discover closed loops. Relies on segments being
in consecutive order within each ring (as produced by establish_topology).

Each cycle is a vector of vertex IDs in traversal order. The cycle is closed
(first vertex connects back to last via a segment).
