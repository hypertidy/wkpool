\title{Convert cycles to WKT polygons}
\usage{
cycles_to_wkt(x, feature = TRUE, convention = c("sf", "ogc"))

cycles_to_wkb(x, feature = TRUE, convention = c("sf", "ogc"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A wkpool (ideally after merge_coincident)}

\item{feature}{Logical: attempt to reconstruct original features?
If TRUE, groups cycles by .feature and nests holes in outers.
If FALSE, each cycle becomes a separate polygon.}

\item{convention}{Winding convention: "sf" (default) or "ogc"}
}
\value{
A wk_wkt vector of POLYGON geometries
}
\description{
Convert cycles to WKT polygons
}
\details{
Converts cycles back to polygons. When feature = TRUE, attempts to
reconstruct original polygon structure by grouping rings by feature
and nesting holes within their containing outer ring.
}
