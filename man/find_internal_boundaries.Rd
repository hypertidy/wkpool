\title{Find internal boundaries (edges shared by exactly 2 features, opposite direction)}
\usage{
find_internal_boundaries(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A wkpool after merge_coincident}
}
\value{
A wkpool containing only internal boundary segments
}
\description{
Find internal boundaries (edges shared by exactly 2 features, opposite direction)
}
\details{
Internal boundaries are edges where one feature has segment (v0→v1) and
another feature has (v1→v0) — i.e., they share the edge but traverse it
in opposite directions. This is the defining characteristic of a shared
polygon boundary.

x <- wk::as_wkb(c(

))
