\description{
Find internal boundaries (edges shared by exactly 2 features, opposite direction)
}
\details{
Internal boundaries are edges where one feature has segment (v0→v1) and
another feature has (v1→v0) — i.e., they share the edge but traverse it
in opposite directions. This is the defining characteristic of a shared
polygon boundary.
