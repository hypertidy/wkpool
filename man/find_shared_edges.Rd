\title{Find shared edges between features}
\usage{
find_shared_edges(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A wkpool (ideally after merge_coincident)}
}
\value{
Data frame of edges shared by multiple features
}
\description{

After merging coincident vertices, edges that were duplicated
across features (e.g., shared polygon boundaries) will reference
the same vertex pair. This function finds them and reports which
features share each edge.
