\title{Reverse a cycle's winding direction}
\usage{
reverse_cycle(cycle)
}
\arguments{
\item{cycle}{Integer vector of .vx IDs forming a closed cycle}
}
\value{
The same vertices in reversed order (opposite winding)
}
\description{
Reverse a cycle's winding direction
}
\details{
Flips the traversal direction of a cycle without changing coordinates.
Useful for converting between winding conventions.
