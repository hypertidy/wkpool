\title{Classify cycles as outer rings or holes based on winding}
\usage{
classify_cycles(x, convention = c("sf", "ogc"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A wkpool (ideally after merge_coincident)}

\item{convention}{Which winding convention to use: "sf" (default) or "ogc"
\itemize{
\item sf: negative area = outer, positive = hole
\item ogc: positive area = outer, negative = hole
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with cycle index, signed area, and type (outer/hole)
}
\description{
Classify cycles as outer rings or holes based on winding
