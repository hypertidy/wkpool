Title: Vertex Pool Topology for Well-Known Geometry

Description: Establishes and maintains vertex pool topology for geometry 
    handled by 'wk'. Segments are the atomic unit, vertices are shared via
    integer references into a pool. Topology is made discoverable via coincident
    vertex detection while not requiring modification of the input data. 
    Topological data models follow principles described in Worboys and
    Duckham (2004, ISBN:978-0415283755). The edge-based topology geometry decomposed 
    into vertices and directed edge pairs is a simplification of the quad-edge case in
    Guibas & Stolfi (1985) <doi:10.1145/282918.282923>.
