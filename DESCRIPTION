Title: Vertex Pool Topology for Well-Known Geometry

Description: Establishes and maintains vertex pool topology for geometry 
    handled by 'wk'. Segments are the atomic unit, vertices are shared via
    integer references into a pool. Topology is discoverable (via coincident
    vertex detection) not imposed - representing the truth of the input.
    Topological data models follow principles described in Worboys and
    Duckham (2004, ISBN:978-0415283755).
